# Personal_Projects

I am currently a graduate student pursuing data-driven opportunities in the hopes of applying my analytical and technical skill-set. 
I am a huge advocate of learning and developing intricate and unique solutions for all sorts of applications.
By implementing statistical techniques and machine learning methodologies, I am able to provide clear insight and data-driven decisions.
Building upon my technical engineering background creates a diverse and refreshing take on any problem that may come my way.
As I hone my data science foundation and build my portfolio, feel free to provide any feedback and insight so that I may provide better services for my community and for my connections.

Thank you dearly,
Kyle Lacson
